# React Weather App

Minimalist React weather app utilising the OpenWeatherMap API

Based on the tutorial: https://blog.expo.io/building-a-minimalist-weather-app-with-react-native-and-expo-fe7066e02c09 (amazing way to learn React quickly!)
<br>

## Changes from the tutorial
Added my own tweaks such as displaying the location name and minor appearance changes
